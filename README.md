# Stochastic-Local-Search-SAT-solver

Requirements:

Groovy 2.4.13
To run the solver:

cd /path/to/Solver
groovy solver.groovy `<cnf-file><max flips> <max tries> <noise-parameter>`

This solver implements Walksat algorithm which is an incomplete stochastic local search algorithm used for SAT solving.
